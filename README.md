# Procurement RFx Timeline Predictor for Industrial Assets

## Objective

This project aims to streamline and automate the procurement process in industrial environments (e.g., refineries) by predicting the timeline of RFx (Request for [Quotation/Proposal/Information]) cycles. Using machine learning, the app forecasts the total duration in days based on key procurement features. A Streamlit-based interface enables interaction, and a Power BI dashboard (optional) offers strategic insights into delays and bottlenecks.

## Core Features

### App Interface (Streamlit)
- Lightweight frontend for user input and prediction results.
- Displays similar historical RFx cases for transparency and learning.

### Dashboard Layer (Power BI) *(Optional but Valuable)*
- Monitors patterns and bottlenecks:
  - Average procurement time by category
  - Vendor-wise delay analysis
  - Weekly/monthly timeline deviations
  - Departmental performance insights

### ML Model (In Progress)
- Predicts the total duration (in days) for completing an RFx cycle.
- Input features include:
  - **Material Category**: Chemicals, Heavy Equipment, Spare Parts, etc.
  - **Vendor Type**: Local, National, International
  - **Urgency Level**: Low, Medium, High
  - **Mode of Tender**: Open, Limited, Proprietary
  - **Estimated Cost**: Continuous numeric input
  - **Department**: Mechanical, Electrical, Instrumentation
  - **Historic Delays**: Yes/No (Boolean)
- **Target**: Procurement Completion Days
